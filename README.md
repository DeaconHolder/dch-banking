This is a simple banking application that allows the user to create an account that can be logged into later. The user has the choice of checking their balance, deposit money, withdraw money, or e-transfer to others. This is fake imaginary money for the sake of the program. Accounts made by user's only store the entered information.

This project was coded using Java and display many techniques such as loops, error handling, object-oriented concepts, user input and output, and reading and writing to a file.

Object-Oriented Programming concepts are used as "members" are created. "members" represent the user and holds all their personal information (Name, Password, Amount of money in account).

Error Handling is implemeneted to ensure any input recieved from the user does not harm any pieces of the program.

Thank you for taking the time to read about this banking application project.
